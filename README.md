"EStA" software package for analyzing, pre-processing, and post-processing 
data from different software packages such as vasp, quantum-espresso, gaussian, 
GRRM, xTB, and so on. It can automatically generate input files for vasp, 
quantum-esspresso, and other codes as well can do some model calculations. 
It is written in python3, Fotran90, and some part in C. In future, it will be 
able to perform electronic structure calculations.
