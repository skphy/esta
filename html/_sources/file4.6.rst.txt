.. note:: **surfReact package**:
    Surface reaction tool for finding various atomic structures created using different operations ... more 
    documentation will be added later.

.. include:: ./esta.surfReact.rst

.. note:: **mlBag package**:
   ML related algorithms are implemented such gaussian kernals, etc. Atomic and other descriptors creation is also 
   possible provided DFT or low level calculation results are available.  Also, various other algorithms are 
   called from the well known package sklearn package. 

.. include:: ./esta.mlBag.rst


.. note:: **unit conversion**:
   measure contains unit conversion tool from one units to another units. Also conversion from SI units to 
   atomic units (Hartree units) and atomic Rydberg units is implemented. 

.. include:: ./esta.measure.rst
